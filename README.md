## Suggested Schedule for Computer Lab and Classroom

### Week 1

**Computer Lab:**
- Introduction to GitHub
  - Signing Up on GitHub
  - Managing Issues and Using Project Boards
  - Understanding Markdown and Working with .md Files
- Git Fundamentals
  - Cloning Repositories, Adding Changes, Committing, Checking Status
  - Checking Out Branches, Pushing Changes, Pulling Updates
- Introduction to Colab and Jupyter Notebooks

  - Create a private repository "Programacion_Aplicada" and add GerardoMunoz-UD as a collaborator
  - Log in at your personal Colab account    
  - Copy in your Colab account the [Language Basics Jupyter](https://github.com/GerardoMunoz/Curso_Python/blob/main/PA_01_Elementos_del_lenguaje.ipynb) and add a cell at the top with your personal information and links to each section of the same Jupyter.
  - Save this Jupyter in the GitHub account

**Classroom:**
